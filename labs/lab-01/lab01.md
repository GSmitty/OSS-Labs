## Free Culture Chapter:
For me, I found this chapter to be very frightening. Copyright laws and the giant companies that use them to their advantage truly terrify me, and I find that not only the information and computer science realm, but in entertainment especially, copyright is extremely problematic. This student simply created a framework that was exploited by people he didn't know, and suffered immensely for the unintended side effect. The most disheartening piece of this chapter was the insistence of the company to sue him, or take every penny he had to his name. While I can see their point of view, I find it absurd that they would need to push this hard to receive "damages" for music that likely barely had an effect on their profit margin. Nevertheless, this is simply how the justice system works. Overall, I can now appreciate the non-predatory and non-greedy nature of efforts such as open-source, and am glad that people will put their projects out there knowing very well that it is a loss of possible money in the future.

## How to Ask Questions Suggestions:
1. While I understand that there is really no responsibilty of programmers to answer questions on sites such as stack overflow, I think that the attitude towards questions that aren't written the best way possible can sometimes be a little rude and discouraging, especially to people that are new to programming.
2. Add in personal experience to reassure that some problems happen to everyone, such as a time this program acted strange, or a statement like "happens to a lot of people".
