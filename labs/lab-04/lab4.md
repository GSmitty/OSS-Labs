### Lab 4 Write-Up

# Why is important to have a LICENSE?
Licenses make it explicitly clear how the software can and should be used, and what the rules are for outside users. Without the license, it becomes impossible for a user to safely use and modify your product, as it will default to exclusive copyright, which could cause problems down the line. The license will open up the project to distribution and contribution.

# Why avoid no-license projects?
Projects default to exclusive copyright. Without this license, there could be legal repercussions to your efforts on the project. Just because it is assumed that the product is open to modification, without the license, this is not explicitly stated, and the owner can take any action he wants.

# Do I agree with the Gopher Claim?
From this article, it seems clear to me that this was clearly a point that allowed for the downfall of Gopher. With all of the ideas spread out via "forking" it seems hard to move forward as a property. The cost of licenses also feel like a direct downgrade and disadvantage of Gopher, and this likely pushed many away.

# Linux and GPL
Linux has used the GNU GPL license for a long time, as it was its infancy when linux was, and it has not needed to change the license since then. The GPL license allows for redistribution, as opposed to its precursor copyright clauses, and allows for all that linux is popular for, notably the flavors. This post shows the reasoning, from Linus himself, of why the change to the GPL v2 license occured. https://web.archive.org/web/20070819045030/http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12
